Hello and welcome!
I am a Master of Engineering (M.Eng.) student in the [College of Computing and Data Science (CCDS)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/computing), [Nangyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/) under the supervision of [Prof. Yong Wang](http://yong-wang.org/).

Previously, I earned my Bachelorâ€™s degree in 2024 from the School of Intelligent Systems and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, China, where I was fortunate to be mentored by [Prof. Haipeng Zeng](https://www.zenghp.org/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of Data Visualization, Human-AI Interaction, Computer Vision, and Computer Graphics.

You can find my CV here: [Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
